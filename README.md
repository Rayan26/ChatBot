### chatterbot : 

ChatterBot is a library in python which generates responses to user input. It uses a number of machine learning algorithms to produce a variety of responses. It becomes easier for the users to make chatbots using the ChatterBot library with more accurate responses.


### How Does It work?

ChatterBot makes it easy to create software that engages in conversation. Every time a chatbot gets the input from the user, it saves the input and the response which helps the chatbot with no initial knowledge to evolve using the collected responses.
With increased responses, the accuracy of the chatbot also increases. The program selects the closest matching response from the closest matching statement that matches the input, it then chooses the response from the known selection of statements for that response.

I trained  based on  english greetings and conversations corpora.


### Local Setup:
 1. Ensure that Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, and ChatterBot are installed (either manually, or run `pip install -r requirements.txt`).
 2. Run *app.py* with `python app.py`.
 3. The demo will be live at [http://localhost:5000/](http://localhost:5000/)
